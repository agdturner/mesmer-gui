Number of grains produced is not equal to that requested for: H
Number of grains requested: 500
Number of grains produced : 1
In FastLaplaceConvolution: 5920 values in the FFT convolution routine were replaced by standard convolution
In i-propyl: Delta E down is smaller than grain size: the solution may not converge.

WARNING: Chemically significant eigenvalues (CSE) not well separated from internal energy relaxation eigenvals (IEREs).

The last CSE = -5.33415e-10 and the first IERE = -1.8015e-09
(last CSE)/(first IERE) ratio = 0.296094, which is less than an order of magnitude

Results obtained from Bartis Widom eigenvalue-vector analysis may be unreliable
