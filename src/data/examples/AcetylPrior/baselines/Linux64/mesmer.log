WARNING: Chemically significant eigenvalues (CSE) not well separated from internal energy relaxation eigenvals (IEREs).

The last CSE = -3.596e+07 and the first IERE = -9.02304e+07
(last CSE)/(first IERE) ratio = 0.398535, which is less than an order of magnitude

Results obtained from Bartis Widom eigenvalue-vector analysis may be unreliable
