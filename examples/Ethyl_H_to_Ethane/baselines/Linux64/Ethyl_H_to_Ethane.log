WARNING: Chemically significant eigenvalues (CSE) not well separated from internal energy relaxation eigenvals (IEREs).

The last CSE = -7.04827e+06 and the first IERE = -1.79252e+07
(last CSE)/(first IERE) ratio = 0.393204, which is less than an order of magnitude

Results obtained from Bartis Widom eigenvalue-vector analysis may be unreliable
