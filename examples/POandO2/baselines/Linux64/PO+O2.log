WARNING: Chemically significant eigenvalues (CSE) not well separated from internal energy relaxation eigenvals (IEREs).

The last CSE = -6583.11 and the first IERE = -8431.45
(last CSE)/(first IERE) ratio = 0.78078, which is less than an order of magnitude

Results obtained from Bartis Widom eigenvalue-vector analysis may be unreliable
